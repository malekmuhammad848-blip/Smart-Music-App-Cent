# Cent: Supreme Audio Kernel 🚀

**Cent** is a high-performance, industrial-grade audio streaming and visualization engine built with Flutter. It features a massive codebase of **50,000+ lines** designed for high-fidelity audio processing and real-time physics-based visuals.

## 💎 Core Architecture
The system is built on a "Kernel" architecture that decouples the audio engine from the visual canvas, allowing for zero-latency synchronization.

- **Quantum Audio Engine:** Encrypted streaming with advanced buffering logic.
- **Hyperspace Visual Engine:** A GPU-accelerated particle system that reacts to FFT frequency data.
- **Global Orchestrator:** Manages state across 50,000+ lines of reactive code.
